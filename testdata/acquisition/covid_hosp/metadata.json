            "notes": "<p>The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization <strong>in a timeseries format</strong> dating back to January 1, 2020. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15).</p>\n<p>The file will be updated regularly and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days for all time. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.</p>\n<p>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.</p>\n<p>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to more than one reporting source: HHS TeleTracking, NHSN, and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, prioritization is applied to the numbers for each facility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state-data-dictionary\">COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Data Dictionary</a></p>\n",
